The `*.hex` files you see in this project were analyzed with [ImHex, a fast and delightful hex editor](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex), which made working on that complex data much more enjoyable. In `custom/`, you will find all the patterns I wrote, alongside an ImHex project; a lot of them depend on `type::base58::Encoded` which can be made available using the project. If the latter doesn't open because it is corrupted (that happened to me a couple of times), don't panic and just re-create it manually in place.
